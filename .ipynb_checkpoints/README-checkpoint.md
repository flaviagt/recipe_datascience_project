# Recipe Rating & User Analysis Project
DSC80 at UCSD Final Project

## Step 1: Introduction
As a big foodie and someone who likes to cook, recipes are always the way to go. Especially, when trying out new recipes. Personally, I look for recipes with a lot of reviews and if the cook has multiple other high-rated recipes. Only then, I trust and will try out their recipe myself. (Well, if the food turns out bad, I need to sharpen my cooking skills more!)\
However, this makes me wonder, **is there actually a relationship between a cook's recipe count and their recipe rating?**

Not only limited to the relationship between a cook's recipe count, but what other factors affect a recipe's average rating?\
Hence, this project is here to answer that very question using the power of data!

There are 2 datasets to be used in this project, the ratings and recipe. Ratings dataset consist of the review and/or ratings that users have given to recipes. Recipe dataset consists of the details of the recipes that someone posted (called contributors, users of the web that uploads recipes) along with details on the instructions and nutritional information. 

Dataset Source:\
This dataset contains recipes and ratings from food.com.\
It was originally scraped and used by the authors of a research paper titled, "Generating Personalized Recipes from Historical User Preferences" by Bodhisattwa Prasad Majumder, Shuyang Li, Jianmo Ni, Julian McAuley
